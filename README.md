Spring-Aware-Rule
=================

An example how to replace (most) functionality of a SpringJUnit4ClassRunner by a JUnit TestRule as introduced in [CoreMedia Minds Post][minds-post]

Mind that the rule copies some (and not all) behavior of the SpringJUnit4ClassRunner. So the normal restrictions for copy & paste code also applies to this solution.

**Note:** There is a more complete solution already waiting as [Pull Request 222][spring-framework-pr-222] for the spring-framework addressing this issue which is also described in [SPR-7731][].
